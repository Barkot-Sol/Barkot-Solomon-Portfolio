# Barkot-Solomon-Portfolio
This is a porfolio list of all my work, both Professional and Personal.

I did a professonal logo design for two Oraganizations. 
One of which(also my first) was to [Iconic-Sport-Entertainment](./Professional%20Logo%20design/Iconic%20Sport%20Entertainment).
The other was to [I-Care-for-the-Nation](./Professional%20Logo%20design/I%20Care%20for%20the%20Nation). They are an NGO that aims on helping people and empowering women.

All the folders in the personal project, are well, personal :).
I am a huge fan of the justice league and DC in general, thats what lead me to render the logos of my favorite four characters on that roster. My favorite of all being [Batman](./Personal%20Project/Justice%20League%20Personal%20Renderations/Batman).

Of the [Personal-favorties](./Personal%20Project/Personal%20favorites) my absolute favorite has to be [Captain-america-shield](./Personal%20Project/Personal%20favorites/Captain%20America%20Sheild).

I also like the [barbie](./Personal%20Project/Personal%20favorites/Barbie-style%20list).

I did random logo designs as well, just for me, except [kale-hiwot-logo](./Personal%20Project/Random%20Logos/Unused%20Logo%20Made%20for%20my%20School/). Talks broke down and it never got to be passed.
